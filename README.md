# The Lotus Programming Language

Lotus is an imperative and interpreted programming language being developed on top of Java for an university assignment. While designing it, we strive to provide a clean and flexible syntax while adding a new layer of abstraction.

For more information about the implementation and usage of Lotus, take a look at the documentation (work in progress).
Also take a look in our online presentation (https://prezi.com/llexjbfttwon/lotus/) for a quick view of our ideas (work in progress).

**Some features**
* "Pseudo-dynamic": you can change the type of a variable by redeclaring it;
* Automatic casting: we tried our best to do all the convenient conversions for a heterogeneous assignment of values;
