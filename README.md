# The Lotus Programming Language

Lotus is an imperative and interpreted programming language being developed on top of Java for an university assignment. While designing it, we strive to provide a clean and flexible syntax while adding a new layer of abstraction.

For more information about the implementation and usage of Lotus, take a look at the documentation. You can also take a look at our [online presentation](https://prezi.com/llexjbfttwon/lotus/) for a quick view of our ideas. Keep in mind that both documents *and* the language are in a very early and active development stage.
