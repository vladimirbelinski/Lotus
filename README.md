# The Lotus Programming Language

Lotus is an imperative and interpreted programming language being developed on top of Java for an university assignment. While designing it, we strive to provide a clean and flexible syntax, adding a new layer of abstraction to try to help the developer.

For more information about the implementation and usage of Lotus, take a look at the documentation (work in progress).
